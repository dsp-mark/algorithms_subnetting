# Algorithm Practise: Subnetting (IPv4)

__Live Version__ An interactive webpage can be found [here](https://dsp-mark.github.io/algorithms_subnetting/)

## What is Subnetting?

Since every IPv4 address has been assigned, engineers have been forced to utilize subnetting to extend the lifetime of the IPv4 addressing system.

Subnets take a network range and split it into subnetworks. When done properly this:

- Speeds the network up
- Allows for differing permissions per network

Subnetting requires an **initial network address** and **a subnet mask**. The subnet mask tells the system where the divide between the network address and device address is.

The first address is known as the **Network Address**. Immediately after that, the **First Host Address** is typically given to the subnet's router. The **Broadcast Address** is always the last address on the subnet. Therefore, the useable hosts will always be two less than the total hosts.

## Why Program it?

Everyone has told me that understanding subnetting is crucial for the Network+ exam, so I wanted to program a subnet calculator to better solidify my understanding!

## How this program works:

![Live webpage displaying the transformation of a Network Address and Mask to a Subnet](./screenshots/subnetting-example.png)

Since the algorithm is simple enough (translation into and out of binary), the program is written in JavaScript and hooked up to a webpage (located [here](https://de-mark.github.io/algorithms_subnetting/)).

Once the user provides a base network and subnet, the program will calculate the subnet and fill out the corresponding fields.
